<h2 align="center">ABOUT US</h2>
<p align="center">
  <sub>
(Our strawpage has basically the same info BTW :P)
<p align="center"> Hi!! We prefer to be called Dummy or Lezus (Evan works fine too :D), but you can call us whatever pony we're using ingame! We're diagnosed with OSDD and ASPD, and we're aroace & demiboy. We're Japanese, British, and Bengali and we're still actively learning English...!!

<p align="center"> Bodily 19!!! If you're under 13, do NOT interact with us... If you're under 16, do not expect us to treat you like a close friend, thank you ^_^. Some information about us is that we know many games in Roblox like SEWH, DG/FS, Regretevator, GASA4, Forsaken, Phighting, you get the gist... But we do not like interacting with people apart of those fandoms most of the time, sorry! We're a HUGE fan of Roblox myths though (Can you tell we really like Lezus? No? oh ok), so please don't be afraid to sit near us if you like them too :3

<p align="center"> We're usually offtab/AFK, so don't expect us to reply to you even if you whisper us. We're also VERY C+H friendly, you don't gotta ask even if we have 'DNI' or 'DNIUF' (Unless our friends have it)!! We love cuddles... We probably will be available whenever our friends are around though! Our timezone is UTC+0, and we're usually unavailable by 6:00 AM to 4:40 PM, weekdays only, due to work. Most of the time we're very tired, but we're always up to talk to our friends ^3^
<h2 align="center">BOUNDARIES</h2>
<p align="center"> We're a HUGE Lezus and Dummy fictive, we recommend doubles to not interact with us as we will feel very uncomfortable. People calling us 'dad' and other variants is okay, as long as it doesn't become unhealthy and/or parasocial. We WILL stop this behavior when we deem it necessary. Do not use any feminine terms on us, and are only ever okay if a female alter is present. 
<p align="center">
<sub>
To the people who keep bugging us in our strawpage of why we don't talk at first: We don't owe you an explanation and mind your own business, because us not talking isn't killing anyone, okay..?

<h2 align="center">DNI</h2>
<p align="center">
Our full DNI list is on strawpage. And although we have a DNI list, we don’t take most of it literally; it’s more of a warning if you fall under what it describes. Besides that, we block very freely. People we block are often: People who cover us, Murder Drone fans, -13 attempting to befriend us, and just weirdos in general...
